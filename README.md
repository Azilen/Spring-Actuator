## Spring Actuator

Spring Actuator is the spring based component, which contains features based on spring boot actuator.
It helps to monitor and manage application's health and provide features such as status of application, disk information, database status and other statistics. This information can be retrieved by hitting certain endpoints. Only two end points health metrics have been implemented recently by us.
- **P.S. Spring Actuator Version :- 0.7.0-beta**
- **P.S. Spring Version :- 4.3.4.RELEASE**

### What is Spring Boot Actuator?

To help monitor and manage your application when it is pushed to production, a number of additional features have been included in Spring Boot Actuator. Production ready features to monitor health of spring boot applications have been provided by Spring Boot Actuator.

```

These end points have been integrated with spring boot admin UI server. Spring admin server needs to be started to view admin server. Automatic registration of application will be done to spring admin server once the admin server is running the Spring Actuator sample.
